# Cordova-High-Watch
A highway watching hybrid mobile application made using the Cordova Framework

# About the App
Our motivation behind this application was, as frequent drivers ourselves, when we identified the need for a new and convenient way of tracking weather conditions on nearby roads and major highways that would save us time and stress. We knew this application would need to be intuitive and easy to use, but also very descriptive in order to give the user the best and most helpful experience possible.

	Introducing High-Watch, the new, easy to use application that allows users to easily find and track nearby roadways based on their current locations, including the ability to check the clarity of the roads, visibility, if the roads are clear or not as well as live footage of the roads in almost real-time. Users will be able to save their most travelled roads for a personalized experience which allows the user to easily find their saved roads. Overall, High-Watch is designed to remove the stress out of daily commutes and make the drive to work or school a smooth one.
